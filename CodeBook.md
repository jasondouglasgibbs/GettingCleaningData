## Variables and Data

-   features: raw features data from data set.
-   activities: raw activities data from data set.
-   subjecttest: raw test subject data from data set.
-   subjecttrain: raw training subject data from data set.
-   xtest: raw x test data from data set.
-   ytest: raw y test data from data set.
-   xtrain: raw x train data from data set.
-   ytrain: raw y train data from data set.
-   RecodedData: contains an added “activity” column that has
    descriptive inputs based on the given code.
-   AverageData: final mean data from cleaned data set.

## Transformations

-   Merged xtest, xtrain, ytest, ytrain, subjecttest, subjecttrain files
    into one data set.
-   Extracted measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
    measurement.
-   Added an activity column with descriptive names for each coded
    activity.
-   Expanded column names to be more meaningful.
